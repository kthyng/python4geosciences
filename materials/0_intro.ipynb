The code can be written in over 40 languages including Python, R, and Scala. Most importantly, the code can be interacted with when the notebook is opened in a local (that is, on your computer) iPython server. Alternatively, it can simply be viewed through a github repository (like [this very notebook](https://github.com/kthyng/python4geosciences/blob/master/materials/intro.ipynb)) or through [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).\n",

If you prefer, you are welcome to run Python on your own computer, but you will need to do that mostly on your own. If you go that route, I recommend using Python 3 (which we will be using in class) and a distribution from [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). We'll talk about it as a class later in the semester, too. I recommend you all use this system I have set up for you. It will integrate nicely for our homeworks, too.\n",

Flags can always be combined to use multiple options at once, as in `ls -ah` to show all files in human readable format.\n",

Version control allows changes in code to be tracked over time; this is important for reproducibility, retrieving code in case of accidents, and working on code in groups. Git is one way to version control your code — other methods include subversion (svn), cvs, and mercurial. More information on this is provided below.\n",
